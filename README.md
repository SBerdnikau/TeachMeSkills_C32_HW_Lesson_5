#**Here, following task are implemented**

0. Create a three-dimensional array of integers.
Using loops, "go" through the entire array and increment each
element by a given number. Let the number by which each element will be incremented be specified from the console.

1*. Chessboard
Create a program to color a chessboard using a loop.
Create a two-dimensional array of 8x8 Strings. Using loops, set the
elements of the loops to B(Black) or W(White). The result of the
program:
```
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W
```
2*. Multiplying two matrices
Create two 3x3 arrays of integers (two matrices).
Write a program to multiply two matrices.
First array: {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0}}
Second array: {{1,2,3},{1,1,1},{0,0,0},{2,1,0}}
Expected result: 1 2 3 1 1 1 0 0 0

3. Create a two-dimensional array of integers. Print the sum of all the elements of the array to the console.
